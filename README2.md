# NEW! From the creators of the ever popular: "Snake Game that didn't Really Work but the Snake Kind of Moved Sometimes Anyway"

## We present to you,  "Tank Game that Works a lot Better!"

	Travel to a distant, CYAN_COLOR world far far away where you are thrown into the midst of a timeless, 
	epic struggle between two little diamond things that shoot asteriks at each other. 
	
	Play against a friend or enemy to bring glory to your little diamond thing and rule the day!
	

## Instructions

	- Decide who will control Player 1, they will shoot first in this proverbial duel to the death.
	- Each player can control both the angle (using the u and d keys) and the power (using the < and > keys) 
		of their shot.
	- Once both control settings are to your liking, hit the enter key to fire away!
	- If your shot hits the other player, they will lose one of their 3 lives.
	- Shooting turns alternate between the 2 players until one has lost all 3 of their lives at which point they
		die a firey death.

## Things to Note 
	- After each hit against a player, that player is moved to a randomized position as to prevent using the same
		trajectory for 3 hits in a row.
	- Trash talk is encouraged! Let that little diamond know exactly how much you think it sucks.
	- The creators of this game do not condone shooting asteriks at others in real life.
	
## Critics Rave:
	- "Wow that snake game these guys made was really pretty awful but this one is a lot more fun!"
	
	- "Cyan??? Who would have thought of that as a game color?? Revolutionary!"
	
	- "I'd like to personally say TANK you the creators of this game, really well done."
